These scripts are designed to present minimal pairs of words as auditory (perception) and visual stimuli (silent and articulation/production) during fMRI scans. The original scripts were designed to contrast voiced ('zoo') vs. voiceless ('sue') words
across three task-modes -- silent articulation, overt articulation and passive perception. But the script can be easily adapted to other contrasts. The .m files with the word 'adaptation' in the name make slight changes to the standard block-related
design in order to account for adaptation/habituation effects. Specifically, these scripts present multiple instances of an adaptation type (either voiced or voiceless) followed by a single instance of a test type token (e.g. if the adaptation type was
voiceless, the test type would be voiced). The scripts require psychtoolbox to be installed, and added to the path, of either a Matlab or GNU Octave installation. I have only tested the scripts on GNU Octave, but they should work fine on Matlab.
